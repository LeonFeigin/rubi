# Furigana

This is a Minecraft mod that enables the display of furigana/ruby annotations in Minecraft. There's also a resource pack
that I made/generated which provides compatible furigana for Japanese. It's fairly complete although I haven't checked
_everything_ so there may be some inaccuracies.

Annotations are notated using curly braces like{so}. Non-letters (like *, }, SPACE, etc.) separate annotations from
surrounding words. A single preceding space will be removed to allow for separation without necessitating a visible gap.
A double space can be used in those instances where a space is intended.
