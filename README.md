# Furigana

This is a Minecraft mod that enables the display of furigana/ruby annotations in Minecraft. There's also a resource pack
that I made/generated which provides compatible furigana for Japanese. It's fairly complete, although I haven't checked
_everything_ so there may be some inaccuracies.
